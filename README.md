# Foward and backward kinematics for a six joint serial manipulator
This repo addresses the work done in Lab 1, in the course Robotics at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. The main objective is to investigate direct and inverse kinematics of a Serial Manipulator. The objectives have been to develop/improving skills in use of homogeneous matrix transformations to represent positions and orientations of the rigid
bodies forming a robot, and synthesis of kinematic models for serial manipulators. The work is divided in the two respective parts: direct- and inverse kinematics.
